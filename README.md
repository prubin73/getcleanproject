This repository contains script files and documents for the course project in "Getting and Cleaning Data" (Coursera, section 10, January 2015). The files contained here are as follows:

1. **getData.Rmd** (R Markdown) documents how and when the raw data was downloaded and unpacked. *Knit* it to obtain an HTML or PDF version and/or to run the embedded script.
2. **run_analysis.R** (R script) reads and massages the raw data, tidies it up, and extracts a tidy subset containing averages by activity and subject.
3. **codebook.Rmd** (R Markdown) is the "code book" documenting the variables contained in data frames produced by the ```run_analysis.R``` script.
